## Introduction 
`Graphic Effects` is a project made for introducing us to different graphic effects with OpenGL. <br> 
We chose to implement the NPR (Gooch/Toon) and a skybox effect to our world, all of this based on our past engine. <br> 
This project has been made by **RABINNE Lenny** and **ERBISTI Mat√©o**, students at Isart Digital. <br> 
It started on `January 2nd` and finished on `January 20th`. <br> 

### Controls: 
The default controls are: <br> 
-WASD to move around <br> 
-Hold right mouse button to look around <br> 

## Skybox Effect: 
The first graphic effect that we wanted to do was a great skybox, our old engine had a basic cube with inverted normals to render a 'skybox texture'. <br> 
It was not it so we wanted to improve it. To do so, we used a cubemap supported by OpenGL. <br> 
The goal of this technology is to save 6 2D textures into one and only, so one texture per face. <br> 
After loading the skybox, we obviously need to draw it, it's the first drawn object of the scene. <br> 
For the OpenGL part, we need to disable the `Depth writing` with glDepthMask to draw it, <br> 
then reactivate it for the rest of the scene. This part is useful because the skybox will always be drawn behind everything else. <br> 
Moreover, we did 2 material types: a refractor and a reflector. They both have their own shaders, so the skybox does. <br>

## NPR Effects: 
NPR stand's for Non-photorealistic rendering, basically the well-known way to render abstract or cartoony objects and characters. <br> 
It often uses outlines but the goal wasn't to go in-deep into that technologies, we decided to do basic OpenGL ones. <br> 
We first did render all object's outlines in the back with a black texture, <br> 
then we rendered them 'normally', with their original texture on the front. <br>

### Toon Shader: 
After the skybox, we moved to some shading effects, the first one was the toon/cel shading. <br> 
Basically we implemented a new shader that has his lights divided into (in our case) 5 different parts. <br> 
For example, the smaller the angle between the light direction and the normal is, the bigger the light's intensity will be. <br> 
Once we've calculated the dot product of the light direction and the pixel's normal we can define how bright will be the pixel. <br> 
After that we multiply the pixel's texture color and its given light color to obtain the final rendering. <br>

### Gooch Shader: 
We finally did the Gooch shading which is more of an abstract shading. <br> 
It uses the principle of cold and warm colors, like the more it's exposed to light, the warmer it is. <br> 
To calculate the final color, we have to add the pixel's texture color and color calculated by the gooch shader. <br> 
We also have 2 tweakable values that are the degree of priority given to the cold or warm color over the pixel's texture color. <br>
